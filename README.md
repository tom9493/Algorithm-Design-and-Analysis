# Algorithm Design and Analysis
This is a compilation of algorithms I implemented for my algorithms class at BYU. Some of the folders have reports inside detailing the time and space complexity of the algorithms and more detailed descriptions of the projects. This class taught about problems that have unreasonable time and/or space complexities when done through brute force methods and also the algorithms that can overcome those limitations. 

Convex Hull: This algorithm takes a set of dots and is able to draw a line between all the dots necessary to surround the entire set. Solved with a divide and conquer algorithm. 

Fermat: Fermat's little theorem and the Miller-Rabin conditions. Modular arithmetic algorithms. 

Gene Sequenceing: Two versions of a dynamic programming algorithm. They compute the minimal cost of aligning gene sequences and extracting an optimal alignment. I learned about computational genomics here and understood how knowledge within a particular domain can assist with algorithm design. 

Network Routing: I implemented Dyskstraâ€™s algorithm to find paths through a graph representing a network routing problem. I used two different data structures to represent the priority queue, demonstrating how both the algorithm and data structure can significantly affect performance. 

Traveling Sales Person: This is an NP-Complete problem that tries to find the shortest path between a set of locations, visiting each location exactly 1 time. This was a group project, where we implemented three algorithms: greedy, branch and bound, and ant colony.
